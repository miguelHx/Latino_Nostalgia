# Latinx Nostalgia

Welcome ! This is Latinx Nostalgia, a nostalgic music website. Music is one of the closest things we have to a time machine, because memories may be attached to songs.

As of 8/1/25, I am still gathering youtube ids from the lists of popular songs for each year.  Youtube API limits me to 100 requests per day so with a total of 7663 songs, this will take about 76 days :(.

I will update the website as I gather the youtube ids.

The website is live at this link: [https://www.latinxnostalgia.com](https://www.latinxnostalgia.com)

Here are some screenshots:

This project was inspired by Elliot Slevin's website [the nostalgia machine](http://www.thenostalgiamachine.com).  I took the design from there as inspiration for this project. Here is his [github project](https://github.com/EliotSlevin/NostalgiaMachine).


# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
